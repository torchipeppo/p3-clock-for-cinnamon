# Custom Compendium

A tiny collection of customizations that can be applied to the desklet
in the "Save/Load" page of its settings (NOT the default import command!).
Make sure you activate at least one option before loading.

If you want to apply the style, inspect the JSON file first and make sure
you have the required fonts installed. See the notes below for where to find them.

To submit a new customization here, please open a pull request.

## Description

### persona3.json

The closest reproduction of the HUD from the game "Persona 3" that OFL fonts
and standard emoji allow, referencing the inspiration of this whole endavor.

You may also be interested in one of the first three color schemes:
"Blue", "Pink" and "Green".

Instrument Sans, Onest and Geist are available on Google Fonts.
Onest and Geist can be used in place of each other if you want
a more cohesive style or less fonts to download.

### default.json

The default settings for this applet.

The main reason it's included is to provide an easy way to return the font
to following the system default without having to reset the whole desklet
and lose all the other settings.

Just make sure you only select "Load text style" before loading.
